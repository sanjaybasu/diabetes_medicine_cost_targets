Expanding access to newer glycemic control medicines among people with diabetes mellitus in low- and middle-income countries

Importance: As diabetes mellitus increases in prevalence among low- and middle-income countries, the cost at which the clinical benefit of newer glycemic therapies will meet international criteria for cost-effectiveness remains unclear.

Objective: To determine the expected health impact of and cost thresholds to achieve cost-effectiveness thresholds for glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, sodiumâ€“glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and insulin analogues for people with diabetes mellitus in low- and middle-income countries.

Design: Microsimulation model incorporating inputs from cross-sectional surveys of medical history, biomarkers, and medicines among people with diabetes mellitus in low- and middle-income countries. The microsimulation model used the WHO cardiovascular disease risk model and the Risk Equations for Complications of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (RECODe) to estimate the 10-year risk of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction and stroke), congestive heart failure, nephropathy (end-stage renal disease), retinopathy (vision loss), neuropathy (pressure sensation loss), and hypoglycemia requiring medical attention at current levels of screening, treatment, and control observed in the STEPS surveys. 

Setting: Simulated treatment initiation and uptitration of diabetes medications in healthcare settings of low- and middle-income countries.

Participants: N = 20,287 individuals with diabetes mellitus in 50 countries.

Interventions: The model was used to estimate the incremental decrease in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and incremental cost (in 2020 International Dollars) of transitioning away from sulfonylureas as second-line agents and towards each of the alternative oral medication classes (particularly SGLT-2 inhibitors for those with heart failure or chronic kidney disease, or SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 antagonists for those with atherosclerotic heart disease), as well as enabling choices between human and analogue basal insulin for those with a history of hypoglycemia. DALYs and costs were discounted at a 3% annual rate across a 10-year policy planning horizon.

Main Outcomes and Measures: Incremental reduction in DALYs, incremental increase in healthcare costs including medication costs and costs saved from averted complications, and target medicine price point for cost-effectiveness at a threshold of three times GDP per capita, or cost-neutrality.
